            <h1>About Amy Winehouse</h1>
            <h2>Amy's Background</h2>
            <p>Amy Winehouse was a British singer known for a thick contralto that belied her slender, fragile appearance. Winehouse was known for outsized beehive and celebrated for her deep, rich, supple voice. She took her proprietary mix of R&B, soul, and jazz mainstream and though she released just a few albums, continues to have an impact on generations of artists. Unfortunately, she was also known for her battle with addiction. She lost her battle on July 23, 2011, at the age of 27.</p>

            <h2>Noteworthy Performances</h2>
            <p>Although some opined that Winehouse was most at home when performing for small crowds, most would agree she handily commanded a stage before tens of thousands. Winehouse, sporting her trademark winged eyeliner and messy beehive, performed many times before she died. Below are some of her most memorable performances, according to Harpar's Bazaar.</p>

            <h2>About Amy's Struggle With Addiction</h2>
        <p>When Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning at age 27, it was after years of reported substance abuse. An article on Biography and the biopic "Amy" explain that the artist began smoking marijuana at a young age. Over the years, she tried heroin and other hard drugs. By the time she died, she hadn't released an album in more than five years. The Amy Winehouse foundation was created in her name to help other young people, especially women, cope with the roots of their addiction.</p></section>
